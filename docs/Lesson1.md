# Lesson 1
## Debugging, Sideloading, and Manifest

This lesson covers the core requirements to define and run a Roku app. It also covers some of the APIs available to gather information about the device.  
OK, let's go:

1. Create a directory called `lesson_1`, navigate into it  

1. Create a directory called `source`, navigate into it  

1. Create a file called `main.brs`, open the file, add this code:  
    ```
    sub main()
    ? "Hello World."  
    end sub
    ```
    You have now written a Roku application in the BrightScript programming language. Let's get it to run...   

1. Navigate back into the `lesson_1` directory  

1. Create a file called `manifest`, with no file extension  

1. Edit `manifest` to include this line, note the pound (#) sign  
    ```
    # This is here because this file must be larger than zero bytes.
    ```  

1. Now zip up the _contents_ of lesson_1 (the `manifest` file must be in the root of your zip)  
    <img src="screenshots/l1_zipup.png" width="200"/>  

1. For the next steps, you will need the Roku's IP address. On your Roku, navigate to *System > Network > About*  
    <img src="screenshots/l1_deviceipscreen.png" width="400"/>  

1. Before you upload (aka "sideload") this app to the device, go ahead and open a debugging session.  
    Open Terminal/shell and enter the telnet command:  
    `$ telnet <roku ip> 8085`  
    for example, if your Roku's IP is 192.168.1.93, you will see this:
    ```
    $ telnet 192.168.1.93 8085
    Trying 192.168.1.93...
    Connected to roku.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    ```
    To exit the telnet session, press `CTRL` + `]`, then type `q` at the `telnet>` prompt.  
    You will live and breathe the telnet session as you develop Roku apps. Get familiar with it.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your Roku's IP address. You will need to use the credentials you set up when you registered the device for dev mode.  
    <img src="screenshots/l1_login.png" width="400"/>  

1. Enter the user/pass, and upload the zip you just made  
    <img src="screenshots/l1_installed.png" width="400"/>

1. Watch the telnet session update as the app launches:  
    ```
    ------ Compiling dev '' ------
    11-20 23:06:17.814 [scrpt.cmpl.time] Compiled '', id 'dev' in 0 milliseconds
    11-20 23:06:17.816 [ui.frm.plugin.running.enter] Entering PLUGIN_RUNNING for dev
    11-20 23:06:19.245 [scrpt.run.enter] UI: Entering '', id 'dev'  
    ------ Running dev '' main ------
    Hello World.
    ```
    Congratulations, you just launched your first Roku application! Take a break, you earned it.  

1. Notice how there are no visual elements on screen to represent the application. Let's add them.  Edit the  `manifest` file to include the following:
    ``` bash
    ## Channel Icons
    #### Image size for mm_icon_focus_hd: 290x218px
    mm_icon_focus_hd=pkg:/images/channel_logo_hd.png

    ###  Splash Screen + Loading Screen Artwork
    #### Image size for splash_screen_hd: 1280x720px
    splash_screen_hd=pkg:/images/splash_hd.png
    ```
    Zip and deploy the application again. You should briefly see the splash screen, defined in the line `splash_screen_hd=pkg:/images/splash_hd.png`:  
    <kbd><img src="../lesson_1/images/splash_hd.png" width="400"/></kbd>  

    On the Home Screen, notice the channel logo defined in the line `mm_icon_focus_hd=pkg:/images/channel_logo_hd.png`:  
    <kbd><img src="../lesson_1/images/channel_logo_hd.png" width="250"/></kbd>  
    <img src="screenshots/l1_homescreen.png" width="400"/>

1. Edit the manifest again, adding some custom details for the application. The next step will demonstrate how to leverage it.
    ``` bash
    ##   Channel Details
    title=Roku Lesson 1
    major_version=1
    minor_version=0
    build_version=0

    ## Channel Icons
    #### Image size for mm_icon_focus_hd: 290x218px
    mm_icon_focus_hd=pkg:/images/channel_logo_hd.png

    ###  Splash Screen + Loading Screen Artwork
    #### Image size for splash_screen_hd: 1280x720px
    splash_screen_hd=pkg:/images/splash_hd.png

    ### Custom value, defined by you.
    custom_field=hello_world
    ```

1. Now update the main function in the `source/main.brs` file:
    ```
    sub main()
        ' Print information from Roku manifest
        app_info = createObject("roAppInfo")
        ? "App Title: ", app_info.getTitle()
        ? "App Version: ", app_info.getVersion()
        ? "Channel ID: ", app_info.getID()
        ? "isDev: ", app_info.isDev()
        ? "Custom Field: ", app_info.getValue("custom_field")
    end sub
    ```
    Run it an check the debugger:
    ```
    ------ Running dev 'Roku Lesson 1' main ------
    App Title:      Roku Lesson 1
    App Version:    1.0.0
    Channel ID:     dev
    isDev:          true
    Custom Field:   hello_world
    ```
    This code will print out the values defined in the manifest, using the `roAppInfo` API. There are multiple options available in the manifest for customizing the data available. For more information, read here: https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Roku+Channel+Manifest

1. Continue to edit the `source/main.brs` file:
    ```
    sub main()
        ' Print information from Roku manifest
        app_info = createObject("roAppInfo")
        ? "App Title: ", app_info.getTitle()
        ? "App Version: ", app_info.getVersion()
        ? "Channel ID: ", app_info.getID()
        ? "isDev: ", app_info.isDev()
        ? "Custom Field: ", app_info.getValue("custom_field")
        ' Print information from device
        ? "- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "
        device_info = createObject("roDeviceInfo")
        ? "Model: ", device_info.getModel()
        ? "Display Name: ", device_info.getModelDisplayName()
        ? "Firmware: ", device_info.getVersion()
        ? "Device ID: ", device_info.GetChannelClientId()
        ? "Friendly Name: ", device_info.getFriendlyName()
        display_size = device_info.getDisplaySize()
        ? "Display Size: ", display_size.w;"x";display_size.h
        ? "UI Resolution: ", device_info.getUIResolution()
        ? "Video Mode: ", device_info.getVideoMode()
        ? "IP Address: ",device_info.getExternalIp()
    end sub
    ```
    This code will print out more information about the device, using the `roDeviceInfo` API:  
    ```    
    ------ Running dev 'Roku Lesson 1' main ------
    App Title:      Roku Lesson 1
    App Version:    1.0.0
    Channel ID:     dev
    isDev:          true
    Custom Field:   hello_world
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Model:          4630X
    Display Name:   Roku Premiere+
    Firmware:       298.00E04108A
    Device ID:      YR007C832727
    Friendly Name:  Roku Premiere+ - YR007C832727
    Display Size:    1280x 720
    UI Resolution:  <Component: roAssociativeArray> =
    {
        height: 1080
        name: "FHD"
        width: 1920
    }
    Video Mode:     1080p
    IP Address:     123.456.7.8
    ```

1. Again, edit the `source/main.brs` file and add an argument to the `main()` function:
    ```
    sub main(obj)
    	? obj
        ' Print information from Roku manifest
        app_info = createObject("roAppInfo")
        ... etc ...
    end sub
    ```
    This will print some more analytics describing how the app was launched:
    ```
    ------ Running dev 'Roku Lesson 1' main ------
    App Entry:      <Component: roAssociativeArray> =
    {
        instant_on_run_mode: "foreground"
        lastExitOrTerminationReason: "EXIT_UNKNOWN"
        source: "auto-run-dev"
        splashTime: "1600"
    }
    App Title:      Roku Lesson 1
    App Version:    1.0.0
    Channel ID:     dev
    isDev:          true

       width: 1920
    }
    Video Mode:     1080p
    IP Address:     123.456.7.8
    ```
    Roku actually supports 2 entry point functions, `main` or `runUserInterface`. You must define one or the other for the app to launch. They both do the same thing, so take your pick. Personally, I prefer the concise mystery of tradition's `main`.
    Here's the documentation: https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Development+Environment+Overview#DevelopmentEnvironmentOverview-EntryPoints

That's it for Lesson 1. At this point you should be familiar with the basics of the Roku workflow. Now would be a good time to get familiar with Atom and a deploy script or package. You will be sideloading the app many, many times for the remainder of your Roku career. If you want to use bash & curl, this script is a good one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45285806/programmatically-upload-roku-channel-without-eclipse-plugin/45405595#45405595
